# Image-Classification
Built a TensorFlow Neural Network for the classification of the different type of clothing images

Dataset:
Keras fashion Mnist dataset is used for building the neural network

In this model there is 1 hidden layer with **128** neuron and **relu** activation function

Due to less computation power here only 5 output is displayed if you want all the output just add 
*for i in range(len(test_images)):* instead of `for i in range(5):`
